# Script Python used in cybersecurity
Python script used in cybersecurity, such as a "nmap" made in python, a port "tester" on a website
among others, repository with the intention of helping other people and also for the purpose of own study.

Yours sincerely, gb


# ScanPort_ip:
<p>Put the host in the requested field and the script will scan 1, 1100 ports on the informed host</p>

# ScanPort_web:
<p>Enter the url of the site so that the script can try to connect with some ports (I used some of the most used ports), after that it will be informed which port is open on the chosen site</p>

# AdvancedScanner:
<p>More advanced script compared to the "ScanPort_ip" script, that is, a copy of nmap</p>
